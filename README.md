# SQL Analysis of Customer and Revenue Data

In this project the objective was the analysis of customer level data and revenue metrics from an online retail store using SQL. 

## Tools Used
- SQL (SQLite)
- Python
- Pandas

## Key Findings
- The dataset consists of just under 18,500 orders with just over 4,300 different customers.
- The top 10 customers contribute approximately 16.5% of total revenue; this shows the moderate concentration of customers.
- The orders placed by the customers vary greatly in value from small single item purchases to large volume jobs.
- Approximately 65% of customers will place a repeat order which demonstrates strong customer retention results.
